## Teaching Philosophy

My approach to informatics education centers on practical application. Students learn best when they can connect concepts to real-world problems—whether that's analyzing population health data, improving clinical workflows, or evaluating health IT systems. I emphasize critical thinking over rote memorization, and I design assignments that mirror the kinds of challenges students will face in their careers.

I also believe in meeting students where they are. Many of my students come from clinical backgrounds with limited technical experience, while others are technologists new to healthcare. Effective informatics education bridges these perspectives.
