## The Short Version

I'm an Academic Program Manager at [CITRIS Health](https://citris-uc.org/), UC Berkeley, where I focus on digital health initiatives and AI curriculum development for medical professionals. I'm also an adjunct professor at Indiana University, and Ohio University, teaching courses in health informatics, population health analytics, and clinical informatics.

In 2023, I was inducted as a Fellow of the American Medical Informatics Association (FAMIA).

## Research Interests

My research sits at the intersection of several areas:

- **AI in Medical Education** — Developing curriculum frameworks that prepare healthcare professionals to effectively and responsibly use AI in clinical practice
- **Digital Health & Remote Patient Monitoring** — Designing and evaluating telehealth interventions that work for the communities that need them most
- **Precision Medicine** — Understanding how to prepare healthcare systems and providers for the genomic revolution
- **Medical Education** — Building curricula that prepare the next generation of informaticists and clinicians for a data-driven healthcare landscape

## The Longer Story

My path to informatics wasn't linear. I started in semiconductor manufacturing—first at Intel in Oregon working on Pentium 4 and Xeon processors, then at Cree in North Carolina doing R&D on LED technology. Those years in lean six-sigma manufacturing environments taught me how to think systematically about process improvement, a skill that translates surprisingly well to healthcare.

I returned to academia at the University of Nebraska at Omaha, earning my MS and PhD in Biomedical Informatics. My dissertation, *"The Revolution Will Be Sequenced,"* examined the knowledge gaps that could hinder precision medicine adoption—work that led to ongoing research on how providers interpret genetic test results and how we can better prepare them for genomic medicine.

At UC Berkeley, I helped pilot and manage ACTIVATE, a digital health program bringing remote patient monitoring and care coordination to Federally Qualified Health Centers serving rural and agricultural communities. That work demonstrated that thoughtful technology implementation can improve diabetes and hypertension outcomes in populations often left behind by healthcare innovation. ACTIVATE has since spun out into [Health Tequity](https://www.healthtequity.net/about), continuing to expand its impact.

Currently, my focus has shifted toward AI in medical education—developing curriculum frameworks that help healthcare professionals understand, evaluate, and appropriately integrate AI tools into their practice.

## Teaching

I believe informatics education should be practical, accessible, and grounded in real-world applications. I've developed and taught courses at multiple institutions:

- **Population Health Analytics** (Indiana University)
- **Foundations of Data Analytics** (University of New England)  
- **Health Informatics Systems and Applications** (Ohio University)
- **Clinical Informatics Intensive Workshop** (Ohio University)
- **Public Health Informatics** (University of Nebraska at Omaha)

I've also contributed to curriculum development for biomedical informatics and clinical informatics programs.

## Leadership & Service

I'm actively involved in AMIA governance:

- **2025** — Member, AMIA Nominating Committee; Co-Chair, Governance Committee
- **2022–2023** — Chair, Working Group Steering Committee; Guest of the Board
- **2019–2021** — Chair, AMIA Student Working Group

I previously served as Section Co-Editor for the *IMIA Yearbook of Medical Informatics* (Bioinformatics and Translational Informatics section, 2022–2024) and have served on scientific program committees for AMIA conferences.

## Beyond Work

When I'm not thinking about healthcare data, you'll find me exploring the outdoors with my kids—hiking trails, camping, and logging as many days on the ski hill as Montana winters will allow.
